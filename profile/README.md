# 👋 Welcome to ArcOS!

</div>

ArcOS is an advanced Web Operating System built with reliability and expandability in mind. I've been working hard for years to give you the WebOS experience you deserve. With ArcOS, everything you do is stored in the cloud, so that you can access your stuff from anywhere. Just pop open a browser, type in the address, log in and you're right back on your familiar desktop. ArcOS also has infrastructure put in place to allow users to make and distribute their own apps to other ArcOS users.

> [!WARNING]
> ArcOS is currently in **beta**. Expect missing features, unexpected crashes or weird bugs.

## What can I find here?
In the organization? Not much. Just the 100k LoC ArcOS v7 frontend codebase found [here](https://github.com/ArcOS-Project/v7). Anyway, here are some links:

- You can find ArcOS itself [here](https://os.arcweb.nl/) (ArcOS [v5](https://v5.arcweb.nl) and [v6](https://v6.arcweb.nl) are available too)
- The backend is hosted on [arcapi.nl](https://arcapi.nl/)
- ArcOS has a [discord server](https://discord.gg/t5PaNP9dvg) where we talk about the OS and other cool projects. The periodic changelog is there, too
- ArcOS' website can be found [here](https://arcweb.nl)
- There's [documentation](https://docs.arcapi.nl/) for developing third-party apps using [`v7cli`](https://npmjs.org/package/v7cli).

## Need help?
That's what the discord is for, in part. If you can't figure out how to get to ArcOS, how to make an account, or why you can't get to the desktop, the Discord is there to help you out. Generally however, if you encounter a bug, I'd prefer it if you sent a Bug Report using the _Bug Hunt_ application **inside ArcOS**. This puts all bugs and issues in one centralised place for me to look in, how dandy.

## Disclaimers
Please keep in mind the following list of disclaimers before and whilst using ArcOS:
